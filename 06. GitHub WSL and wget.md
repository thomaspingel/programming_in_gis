# GitHub
GitHub is a tool through which you can create repositories to hold code that you (and others!) contribute to.  Most of the major packages we've covered this semester have a GitHub presence.  For example:
* [Esri](https://github.com/esri) and their [Deep Learning Frameworks](https://github.com/Esri/deep-learning-frameworks)
* [Geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)
* [Rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio)
* And even major Python pacakges including [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), and [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).

Many individuals and groups publish to GitHub.  Here are a few more:
* [Me!]()
* [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes)
* [The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency](https://github.com/ngageoint)

## Getting Started
1. GitHub is how development gets done these days!  So it pays to be familiar with the basics.  Getting an account is free.  There is a link on the main [github.com](https://github.com/) page.
2. GitHub can act a little like a social media platform.  You can follow individuals/accounts.  Try following [me](https://github.com/thomaspingel) for now, and any of accounts listed above (or others you're interested in).  You can also follow individual repositories.  I will be folding most of the coursework we've done this semester into my [programming_in_gis](https://github.com/thomaspingel/programming_in_gis) repository, so you may wish to follow that.  My most "public" repositories are for [neilpy](https://github.com/thomaspingel/neilpy) and [smrf](https://github.com/thomaspingel/smrf).
3. You can "fork" repositories that you want to copy or contribute to.  Try forking a previous version of the code for this class at [intro_to_geospatial_python](https://github.com/thomaspingel/intro_to_geospatial_python).  My [Open Source Geospatial Tools for Python](https://github.com/thomaspingel/intro_to_geospatial_python/blob/master/10.%20Open%20Source%20Geospatial%20Tools%20for%20Python.ipynb) is a favorite of mine, but I'm breaking it into pieces (and some of it is outdated).  Even so, a good resource!
4. GitHub lets you host websites called [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/).  Most people create one for their username (mine is [thomaspingel.github.com](https://thomaspingel.github.io/).  Instructions for starting are [here](https://pages.github.com/).  You'll be using GitHub Desktop.  This site could be used to create a portfolio or other web presence that might help you show your work to, say, a future employer.  A former student [Grace Fernandez](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio) did something like this.  At the moment, it's enough to create the repository (your username).
5. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).  You'll use this to make edits.  Login, and clone a repository.  Browse to the new one you just created for your website.  "Pull" down the site.  GitHub works by pulling and pushing code.  When you make edits locally, you'll push it back up.  GitHub lets you code directly on the site as well, and this is good for small to medium code edits.  Create a text file called index.html, and we'll populate it with some [basic content](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/bc010e6ed25b802da7eb).  Website development is beyond the scope of the course, but there are many tutorials out there.  When you're done, you can use GitHub Desktop to push your code back up.  Wait a few minutes for the site to render, and then try visiting the site.
6. You can create and develop many types of repositories!  GitHub can host Python, JavaScript, C, any type of codebase.  It's entirely agnostic.  I use it to host a lab wiki that my students can collectively use and edit.  That repo is private, which requires a paid subscription, but I've found it very useful.  GitHub isn't for holding large files/data though, so be mindful of limits.  Generally you want to avoid any single large file (> 100 MB).  You might notice the readme.md files have that "md" extension, meaning Markdown.  So anything you've been using to annotate your Jupyter Notebooks will work here.

# Windows Subsystem for Linux
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a key toolkit.  WSL is an integrated shell (not a virtual machine) that lets you run Linux directly.  With Windows 11 (and some Developer Builds of Windows 10) you can easily launch GUI apps as well, something that formerly required the installation of a separate [Display Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system#Display_server) such as [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).  We typically use WSL to access Linux-specific tools like [ROS](https://github.com/thomaspingel/neil/wiki/Robot-Operating-System-(ROS)) and [wget](https://github.com/thomaspingel/neil/wiki/wget), to easily access more powerful Linux shell scripting, or to use Linux-variants of common tools like [ffmpeg](https://github.com/thomaspingel/neil/wiki/ffmpeg).  Other ways to run Linux in Windows include using [Hyper-V](https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/windows-10-tip-run-ubuntu-linux-in-an-enhanced-hyper-v-session/) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). 

It is strongly recommended that users don't access the WSL file structure from Windows.  Instead, it's generally better to move to the Windows file system (while in WSL) to access those files (there is no problem with Linux accessing Windows files and folders).  To do this, change directories (where "c" is whatever drive your data is stored on):
~~~
$ cd /mnt/c/your/file/path
~~~

## Installation
* Install latest [vGPU drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)!  [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-10-windows-11-dch-drivers.html), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-wsl-support), [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl)
* Open a command prompt with Administrator rights and run:
~~~
wsl --install
~~~
* Note: Other switches include "wsl --list --online" to get a list of distros available, and wsl --install -d <DistroName> to install a specific one. wsl --update will update the kernel, and wsl --update rollback will roll it back.  wsl --status will give info about the install. Once WSL is installed, you can also go to the Windows Store, and do a search (e.g., "Ubuntu 18.04") and install a distro that way.
* Reboot, and open the Ubuntu app.  Set up a username and password.  Then:
~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
~~~
* Test an X Windows application:
~~~
sudo apt install x11-apps -y
xeyes (or xcalc, xclock)
~~~

# WGET
Wget is a powerful way to download large directories of information that are difficult to access via other mechanisms.  It can download via http, https, and ftp.  We typically use it via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  Examples of use include scraping websites to get copies of SRTM or lidar data when they are distributed via web pages.  A similar tool is [curl](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/what-is-curl-command/).  Wget is very powerful, so be sure to [read the manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) so you know how to properly use it.  We often use wget to download pages on open FTP or HTTP servers with simple links of files, or text files that contain lists of files to download (e.g., NASA EarthData lists), or to mirror whole websites.

Want to download stuff, but hate Linux?  Try [uGet](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/uget-instructions/index.html) instead.

## Example: NEXRAD Mosaics
Download a day's worth of radar files from [Iowa State's NEXRAD mosaics](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/docs/nexrad_mosaic/).  The -nd specifies you don't want directories, the -nc "no clobber" so it doesn't download things you have already, and -np is "no parent", so it won't travel up (FTP directories often let you do this!).
~~~
wget -i https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/archive/data/2023/04/23/GIS/uscomp/ -nd -nc -np
~~~

## Example: Download all the hourly CORS files for GPS post-processing
~~~
wget ftp://geodesy.noaa.gov/cors/rinex/2020/240/ls04/ --mirror -nd -A .20o.gz
~~~

## Example: Downloading EarthExplorer datasets using an exported TXT list of files (only URL column kept):
~~~~
wget --load-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --save-cookies ~/.urs_cookies --keep-session-cookies --no-check-certificate --auth-no-challenge=on -r --reject "index.html*" -np -e robots=off -i nasadem_slope.txt --user=thomas.pingel --ask-password
~~~~

## Example: Download Entwine Example, including JavaScript Files
~~~
wget https://potree.entwine.io/data/view.html --mirror -p
~~~

## Example: Linked files on a different server
* Suppose you want to download all of the lidar files on https://www.land-oberoesterreich.gv.at/211787.htm
* If you view the source on this page, you'll see that linked files actually reside on a slightly different server (e.g., https://e-gov.ooe.gv.at/at.gv.ooe.intramapgem/dop/downloads/41101/41101_DGM_xyz.zip).  By default, wget will not look for these files.
* In this case, you might try this command
~~~
wget https://www.land-oberoesterreich.gv.at/211787.htm -r -np -nd -nc -Azip -l 1 --span-hosts
~~~
* where in addition to the "normal" options (-r: recurse, -np: no parent, -nd: don't create directories, -nc: no clobber, so don't delete files I've downloaded, -Zzip: only download zip ifles, -l 1: follow one link deep, --span hosts: OK to go out from this server)


## More Examples:
* Downloading a list of files in a text file using a site that requires a username as password that you don't want to type into the command-line: 
* wget ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/ -r -l inf -nd -nc -np
* wget -i https://ftp.vgingis.com/Download_2/LiDAR/2010/bbrg/zlas/ -r -l inf -nd -nc -A .zlas
* wget --mirror -np https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/provisional/MEaSUREs/NASADEM --user=thomas.pingel --ask-password
* wget --mirror -np https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/PullDir/030460451711176 --user=thomas.pingel --ask-password
* wget –input list.txt –user=thomas.pingel –ask-password
* wget https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/PC_Bulk/TAHOE/ -r -l inf -nd -nc -np user=thomas.pingel@gmail.com --ask-password
